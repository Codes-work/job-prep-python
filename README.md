# Day 1 - Python Job Prep

This is **Day 1** of my **7-Day Python Job Preparation Challenge**.  
The goal is to brush up on Python fundamentals for junior developer and AI/ML roles.

## Topics Covered
- Variable swapping without a third variable
- Taking user input
- FizzBuzz problem
- Character frequency count
- Removing duplicates from a list (2 methods)
- Merging dictionaries
- Calculating averages from a list of dictionaries

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Run:
   ```bash
   python day1_prep.py

# Day 2 – Python Job Prep

Single-file solutions for **Day 2** of the 7-Day Python Job Prep series.  
Covers **Strings**, **Lists & Dictionaries**, and **Loops & Conditions** — all implemented as reusable functions.

## Sections & Problems

### A) Strings
- `reverse_string(s)`
- `is_palindrome(s)`
- `count_vowels(s)`

### B) Lists & Dictionaries
- `find_max_min(numbers)`
- `sum_even_numbers(numbers)`
- `merge_lists_unique(list1, list2)`
- `element_frequency(lst)`
- `remove_duplicates(lst)`
- `merge_dicts(dict1, dict2)`
- `average_score(students)`

### C) Loops & Conditions
- `fizzbuzz(n)`
- `factorial(n)`
- `sum_of_digits(n)`
- `fibonacci(n_terms)`
- `count_even_odd(numbers)` *(list-based)*
- `count_even_odd_range(start, end)` *(range-based)*
- `pattern_triangle(rows)`

> **Note on repetition:** Some problems also appeared in Day 1.  
> Day 1 focused on **direct scripting**; Day 2 refactors them into **clean, testable functions**.
